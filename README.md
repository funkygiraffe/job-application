# Projects
If you've arrived here, you're probably someone who's looked at my resume and are considering hiring me... (or so I hope). 

Welcome! Here you'll find projects and code that I've chosen to make public to show my skills in research and data analysis. Please feel free to explore, and if you like what you see, don't hesitate to reach out. 

## 1. Happiness Data Analysis 
Skills: Data cleaning, data modelling, linear regression
In this project, I analyzed data from the World Happiness Report to investigate the relationship between gdp and happiness by country and region of the world. I cleaned data, modelled relationships using multiple linear regression, and performed statistical tests to investigate the strength of the relationship.

## 2. Climate Weather Analysis 
In this project for my Honours Econometrics class, we set out with some classmates to analyze the potential relationship between warming temperatures and agricultural crop prices (as reflected in the Farm Product Price Index) in Canada. While I was not ultimately successful in establishing a relationship, I did create a "weather-basket" for Canada which drew on publicly available weather data of indexes of average monthly temperature, number of observations in a month of weather over 25c and 30c, and precipitation data, and then performed regressions to analyze the relationship.

## 3. ARIA Research on Religious Authority
This was a poster I presented at the research night for the McGill Faculty of Arts in Fall 2022 that summarizes the political theory research I conducted over the summer with the selective Arts Research Internship Award (ARIA) program under the guidance of a McGill University Political Theorist.
