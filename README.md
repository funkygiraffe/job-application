# Projects
If you've arrived here, you're probably someone who's looked at my resume and are considering hiring me... (or so I hope). 

Welcome! Here you'll find projects and code that I've chosen to make public to show my skills in research and data analysis. Please feel free to explore, and if you like what you see, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Projects:
1. Happiness Data Analysis 
2. Climate Weather Analysis 
3. ARIA Research on Religious Authority
